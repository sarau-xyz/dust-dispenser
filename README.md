# Dust-dispenser 
Dust-dispenser is an airdrop service for Celo Network, which is connected to Lava Network RPC Endpoint. 

That makes it possible, by purchasing a fraction of Celo, to create small free events on the sarau.xyz dapp.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
1. Fork / clone this repo
2. npm install
3. npm run dev to test locally
4. npm run deploy to deploy
```
